# ``E2Syntax`` [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Vurv78/WebAudio?color=red)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
Adds [Expression2](https://github.com/wiremod/wire) syntax highlighting to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Why?
1. To hopefully get the language on Github Linguist
2. So we could get proper syntax highlighting instead of using Golo
3. As hopefully a decent way to create E2 code outside of the game.

## Features
1. 100% Covered Syntax Highlighting
2. Code Snippets (Autocomplete statements & expressions)
3. Code folding compatibility

## Usage
This is currently not on the VSCode Extensions Market.  
Put this into your User folder's .vscode/extensions folder and it will work.
