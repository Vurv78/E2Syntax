# ``E2Syntax`` [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Vurv78/E2Syntax?color=red)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Adds [Expression2](https://github.com/wiremod/wire) support to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Features
1. 100% Covered Syntax Highlighting
2. Autocomplete through code snippets
3. In IDE information like return type, OpS cost, parameter names..
4. Code folding compatibility
5. Whitelisted highlights that help you tell if your code is invalid.

## Why?
1. To hopefully get the language on Github Linguist
2. So we could get proper syntax highlighting instead of using Golo
3. As hopefully a decent way to create E2 code outside of the game.

## Usage
This is currently not on the extensions market.  
Put this entire repo into your User folder's ``.vscode/extensions`` folder and it should work, otherwise make an issue.

## Contributing
Issues and PRs are always open.
