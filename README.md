- [x] Code folding compatibility
- [x] Whitelisted highlights that help you tell if your code is invalid.

## Why?
1. To hopefully get the language on https://github.com/github/linguist
2. For proper syntax highlighting instead of golo.
3. As a decent way to create this code outside of the in-game editor.
4. For https://github.com/Vurv78/ExpressionScript
