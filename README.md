# E2Syntax
Adds [Expression2](https://github.com/wiremod/wire) syntax highlighting to VSCode.

## Why?
1. Because I can
2. So I could hopefully get Expression2 on Github Linguist
3. So we could get proper E2 syntax highlighting instead of using Golo

## Features
1. Code Folding (Matches parenthesis & Brackets)
2. 100% Syntax Covered Highlighting

## Usage
This is currently not on the VSCode Extensions Market.  
Put this into your User folder's .vscode/extensions folder and it will work.
